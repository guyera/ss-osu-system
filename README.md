# BBN Intro

This package is the BBN-Symbiant-OSU Sail-On TA2 system applied to the UMD TA1 svo-classification task.

Here is a sample invocation, to be issued from the toplevel sailon-svo directory:
```bash
python main.py \
--data-root <path-to-images> \
--scg-ensemble <path-to-pretrained-SCG-ensemble> \
--pretrained-unsupervised-novelty-path <path-to-pretrained-unsupervised-module> \
--sys_results_dir <path-to-a-writeable-directory-for-temp-storage-of-results-to-be-sent-to-the-API> \
--detection_feedback
```

There is a classification_feedback argument that could be added, but our system does not currently implement it.

There is also a given_detection argument that will be supported in our final system, but is not yet supported in this version.

While our system will function if the detection_feedback argument is omitted, it will apply its initial strategy throughout, rather than demonstrating adaptation.  We are assuming that the main evaluation runs will be with detection_feedback turned on. 

If you have questions, please contact <lance.ramshaw@raytheon.com>.

The remainder of the README is taken from the UMD repo from which this was forked early in the development
of our system.

# sailon-svo

This is the repo for the SAIL-ON SVO. Spatially Conditioned Graphs (SCG) is the baseline.

## Prerequisites

1. Download the repository with `git clone https://github.com/pi-umd/sailon-hoi`
2. Install the lightweight deep learning library [Pocket](https://github.com/fredzzhang/pocket)

Sample steps that can be followed if you're unable to follow the steps given above:
```bash
cd ~/sailon-svo
git clone https://github.com/fredzzhang/pocket.git
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"<path to this dir>/sailon-svo/pocket"
```
3. Make sure the environment you created for Pocket is activated. You are good to go!
4. A conda environment file `svo.yml` is provided for easy installation of other prerequisites.

## Data Utilities

### Custom Sailon Data

1. Images, annotations and pretrained model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/18sp-dXGFyIfOH2K3ZZVfDLAna_rCEcn9)

```md5sum of model file: 70536666cc873e3b8848bb83416771bb```

## Training

```bash
cd /path/to/sailon-hoi
python train.py --net scg --world-size 8 &>log &
```

Specify the number of GPUs to use with the argument `--world-size` and specify the model you want to use with `--net`

## Testing

```bash
cd /path/to/sailon-hoi
python test.py --net scg --world-size 8 &>log &
```

Specify the number of GPUs to use with the argument `--world-size` and specify the model you want to use with `--net`

## Baseline performance

Top-k performance of the SCG model on the custom SAIL-ON data

|         |       | Train | Validation | Novel Validation |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|------------------|
| Triplet | Top-1 | 0.993 | 0.961      | 0.310            |
|         | Top-3 | 0.996 | 0.973      | 0.586            |
| Subject | Top-1 | 1.000 | 0.991      | 0.609            |
|         | Top-3 | 1.000 | 0.997      | 0.977            |
| Object  | Top-1 | 0.995 | 0.973      | 0.747            |
|         | Top-3 | 1.000 | 0.997      | 0.908            |

```
NOTE: We should note that model is not trained using any unknown data, so 0th index are not meaningful to use right now. Theyâ€™ll be used in the next update of training data
```

## NOTE

For evaluation, we will first look for triplets in 'top_k_triplets' and if this key is empty then we will pull triplets from 'triplet_tensor' key

Hardware: single instance of NVIDIA Quandro P6000 (24G)

Inference Stats:
* Time/Iter: ~80ms
* GPU mem. footprint: ~2.6G
